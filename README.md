## Project Files & Structure

This project is built with standard web technologies and follows a structure typical for Chrome extensions.

* `manifest.json`: The core configuration file for the Chrome extension. It defines permissions, content scripts, the popup action, and icons.
* `display.html`: Defines the HTML structure for the popup window that users interact with.
* `display.js`: Contains all the JavaScript logic for the popup, including handling button clicks, checkbox changes, and communication with the content script.
* `content.js`: This script is injected directly into YouTube watch pages. It's responsible for finding and hiding/showing the comments and sidebar elements based on messages from the popup.
* `styles.css`: Contains the CSS styles that are injected into YouTube pages, primarily for styling the on-page notifications when focus mode is enabled.
* `icon.jpg`: The display icon for the extension, used in the toolbar and the Chrome Web Store.
